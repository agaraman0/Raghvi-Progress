Space Complexity and Time Complexity used to analysis of algorithms.It tells about the effecieny of algorithm

Time Complexity- Relation between input size and running time
time complexity is also the number of operation done by input
as we increase the input size the time complexity will also increase
three types to find time complexity:
1) Best case(minimum time)omega
2) Average case theta
3) Worst case(maximum time) O
when we want to solve the question we always take worst case

Space Complexity- a codes space complexity explain that how much memory takes and it depends on the how much variable are store in memory because of that code.
In arrays space complexity will be depend on input size.
