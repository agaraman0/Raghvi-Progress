# code block A
outer loop of i will run "n"times
and inner of j will also run n times soo
both are depend on each other then 
iteration numeber=n*n=n^2
time compl.=o(n^2)

# code block B
outer loop of i will run "n"time 
inner loop of j will run i times so iteration is sum of n-1 numbers
total iteration=n*(n-1)/2
time compl.=o(n^2)
we can ignore 1/2 by o notation

# code block C
 loop of i will run n times
 loop of j will run n times 
this time both are independent loops
so
n+n=2n 
time complexity=o(n)
can ignore 2 by o notation

 A and B has same time complexity which is greater than C
